## External Dependencies

### context
- **Purpose**: Provides Context type for cancellation, deadlines, and value propagation to event handlers.
  - **Required Interfaces**:
    - `context.Context`: Standard Go context interface for managing request-scoped data, cancellation signals, and deadlines.
      - **Methods**:
        - `Deadline`
          - **Signature**: `Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool)`
          - **Parameters**: None
          - **Returns**: deadline (time.Time): The time when the context's work should be canceled. ok (bool): True if a deadline is set, false otherwise.
        - `Done`
          - **Signature**: `Done() <-chan struct{}`
          - **Parameters**: None
          - **Returns**: <-chan struct{}: A channel that is closed when the context's work is canceled or times out. Consumers can select on this channel.
        - `Err`
          - **Signature**: `Err() error`
          - **Parameters**: None
          - **Returns**: error: The reason the context was canceled. Returns `nil` if not yet canceled, `context.Canceled` if canceled, `context.DeadlineExceeded` if timed out.
        - `Value`
          - **Signature**: `Value(key any) any`
          - **Parameters**: key (any): The key for which to retrieve a value.
          - **Returns**: any: The value associated with `key`, or `nil` if no value is associated or the key is invalid.
- **Installation**: `Go Standard Library - no installation needed.`
- **Version Compatibility**: `Compatible with Go 1.22+`

### sync
- **Purpose**: Provides fundamental synchronization primitives like mutexes and wait groups for safe concurrent access and goroutine management.
- **Installation**: `Go Standard Library - no installation needed.`
- **Version Compatibility**: `Compatible with Go 1.22+`

### sync/atomic
- **Purpose**: Provides low-level atomic memory primitives for safe, lock-free updates to shared variables (e.g., counters, flags).
- **Installation**: `Go Standard Library - no installation needed.`
- **Version Compatibility**: `Compatible with Go 1.22+`

### time
- **Purpose**: Provides functionality for measuring and displaying time, including durations, timestamps, and timers, essential for batching, delays, and timeouts.
- **Installation**: `Go Standard Library - no installation needed.`
- **Version Compatibility**: `Compatible with Go 1.22+`

### container/list
- **Purpose**: Implements a doubly linked list, used as the internal unbounded queue for buffering events in asynchronous mode.
- **Installation**: `Go Standard Library - no installation needed.`
- **Version Compatibility**: `Compatible with Go 1.22+`

### runtime
- **Purpose**: Provides interaction with the Go runtime, primarily used for panic recovery and stack trace capture in error handling.
- **Installation**: `Go Standard Library - no installation needed.`
- **Version Compatibility**: `Compatible with Go 1.22+`

## Peer Dependencies

### Go Runtime Environment
- **Reason**: Required for compiling and executing the `go-events` library and any application using it.
- **Version Requirements**: `>=1.22`
