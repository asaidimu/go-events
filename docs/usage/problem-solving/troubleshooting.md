# Problem Solving

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Events are being dropped in Async mode:**
    *   **Symptom**: `DroppedEvents` metrics increase, `MaxQueueSize` may be reached, or events are emitted but never processed.
    *   **Possible Causes**: 
        1.  No active subscribers for the event name when `Emit` is called.
        2.  Asynchronous queue is full (`MaxQueueSize` reached) and `BlockOnFullQueue` is `false`.
        3.  A global `EventFilter` is filtering out the event.
    *   **Checks**: 
        -   Verify that `Subscribe` calls for the specific `eventName` are executed *before* corresponding `Emit` calls.
        -   Check `EventBusConfig.MaxQueueSize` and `EventBusConfig.BlockOnFullQueue`.
        -   Examine `EventBusConfig.EventFilter` and any per-subscription `Filter` functions in `SubscribeOptions`.
    *   **Fixes**: Increase `MaxQueueSize`, set `BlockOnFullQueue` to `true` to apply backpressure, ensure subscriptions are active, or adjust filter logic.

*   **Handler panics crash the bus:**
    *   **Symptom**: Application crashes with a panic stack trace originating from an event handler, even though `go-events` has panic recovery.
    *   **Possible Causes**: The panic is occurring *outside* the direct execution context of the `EventHandler` (e.g., in a goroutine launched by the handler itself without proper recovery, or during type assertion if not handled defensively).
    *   **Checks**: Review your `EventHandler` implementations for any goroutines launched or unchecked type assertions. Ensure `ErrorHandler` is configured in `EventBusConfig`.
    *   **Fixes**: Wrap custom goroutines within handlers with `defer func() { if r := recover(); r != nil { /* handle */ } }()` or use `TypedEventBus` to avoid runtime type assertion errors. Ensure `ErrorHandler` is capturing and logging details.

*   **`bus.Close()` hangs or takes too long:**
    *   **Symptom**: Application shutdown is delayed, `Close()` method blocks indefinitely or for an extended period.
    *   **Possible Causes**: 
        1.  `EventBusConfig.ShutdownTimeout` is too short for the volume or processing time of pending asynchronous events.
        2.  Long-running event handlers are not checking `context.Done()` and continue processing past the shutdown signal.
    *   **Checks**: 
        -   Monitor `QueueSize` and `ProcessedBatches` metrics just before shutdown to estimate backlog.
        -   Inspect long-running handlers to ensure they respect the `ctx.Done()` signal passed to them.
    *   **Fixes**: Increase `ShutdownTimeout` in `EventBusConfig`. Modify handlers to exit gracefully when `ctx.Done()` is closed (e.g., using a `select` statement).

*   **Context cancellation/timeout in handlers:**
    *   **Symptom**: Event handlers receive `ctx.Done()` or `ctx.Err()` indicating cancellation/timeout, and their processing is interrupted.
    *   **Possible Causes**: The `EventBusConfig.EventTimeout` is too short for the handler's typical execution time.
    *   **Checks**: Measure the typical execution time of your event handlers. Compare with `EventBusConfig.EventTimeout`.
    *   **Fixes**: Increase `EventTimeout` if the handler legitimately requires more time. Optimize handler logic to complete within the configured timeout. Ensure handlers check `ctx.Done()` periodically for long operations.
