# Introduction

**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 95%)

The `go-events` library provides a robust and flexible in-memory event bus solution for Go applications. It enables decoupled component communication through synchronous and asynchronous event processing. Key features include customizable error handling with retries and a Dead Letter Queue, versatile event filtering, comprehensive operational metrics, and graceful shutdown. Through a pluggable `CrossProcessBackend` interface, it can also facilitate communication across different application instances or services, making it suitable for both monolithic and distributed event-driven architectures.
