# Introduction

**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 100%)

The `go-events` library provides a robust and flexible in-memory event bus for Go applications. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous event processing, customizable error handling, event filtering, and comprehensive metrics. Designed for decoupling components, it enhances modularity, testability, and scalability within a single application or across multiple services via pluggable backends. Key features include flexible event handling with filters and one-time subscriptions, controlled event dropping in asynchronous mode, configurable retries and timeouts for handlers, and a type-safe `TypedEventBus` wrapper using Go generics.
