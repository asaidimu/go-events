# 1.0.0 (2025-06-14)


* feat(bus)!: introduce in-memory event bus with full documentation ([fb30552](https://github.com/asaidimu/go-events/commit/fb3055295dfaf61b5783364deebfdd58f03a31c6))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* This commit entirely replaces the repository's previous placeholder "hello world" project with the functional go-events library. All prior code in main.go and pkg has been removed. Users upgrading from the previous state must adopt the new go-events API.
